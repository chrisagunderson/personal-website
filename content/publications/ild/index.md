### "Although interoceptive performance was associated with greater physiological reactivity to lies versus truth, and optimal use of this information would produce deception detection accuracy that far exceeded chance, interoceptive individuals did not leverage their increased body accuracy to improve their judgments of veracity."

## Abstract

Recent research suggests that people experience distinct physiological reactions to lies versus truths. It is unclear, however, if this experience is incorporated into greater truth-lie judgment accuracy. We hypothesized individuals with high interoceptive accuracy—those with greater access to bodily experiences and stronger physiological responses to emotional stimuli—might be particularly likely to accurately discriminate high-stakes, emotional lies and truths. Participants (n = 71) completed two study sessions: the first assessed their interoceptive accuracy with heartbeat detection measures and the second assessed their deception detection ability while measuring their physiological reactivity. Interoceptive accuracy was associated with a greater difference in vasoconstriction to liars (vs. truth-tellers), suggesting that interoception was positively associated with physiological sensitivity to deception. Interoceptive accuracy, however, was unrelated to deception detection accuracy. While better interoception provides enhanced physiological signals that could better discriminate lies from truths, it does not improve deception detection accuracy.
