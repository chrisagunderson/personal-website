### "Bringing together findings on emotion and deception, we find that naive observers—in the absence of suspicion—experience less sympathy and offer less help to deceptive (vs. genuine) expressers of sadness and deceptive murderers (vs. genuine individuals) pleading for help to find a missing relative. Furthermore, observers used an empirically valid cue to deception to inform their emotional reactions: difficult- to-fake facial actions associated with sadness."

## Abstract

Emotional expressions evoke predictable responses from observers; displays of sadness are commonly met with sympathy and help from others. Accordingly, people may be motivated to feign emotions to elicit a desired response. In the absence of suspicion, we predicted that emotional and behavioral responses to genuine (vs. deceptive) expressers would be guided by empirically valid cues of sadness authenticity. Consistent with this hypothesis, untrained observers (total N = 1,300) reported less sympathy and offered less help to deceptive (vs. genuine) expressers of sadness. This effect was replicated using both posed, low-stakes, laboratory-created stimuli, and spontaneous, real, high-stakes emotional appeals to the public. Furthermore, lens models suggest that sympathy reactions were guided by difficult-to-fake facial actions associated with sadness. Results suggest that naive observers use empirically valid cues to deception to coordinate social interactions, providing novel evidence that people are sensitive to subtle cues to deception.
