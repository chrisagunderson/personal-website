### "Successful deception did not result in robust positive affective responses, casting doubt on the magnitude and frequency of duping delight."

## Abstract

Given the paucity of experimental work on duping delight, the present studies explore the affective consequences of successful lying. Specifically, we conducted two experiments wherein participants lied or told the truth in a mock insurance claim, received feedback about whether their claim was believable or not, and subsequently reported on their affect. We also measured participants’ level of Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism to explore whether the experience of duping delight may be moderated by these personality traits. Successful deception did not result in robust positive affective responses, casting doubt on the magnitude and frequency of duping delight. Overall, liars who received believable feedback did not report greater positive affect than liars who received not believable feedback. However, findings suggest that “dark” personalities may be more likely to experience duping delight than others, providing a potential mechanism for why they lie so much. Future research is necessary to understand the conditions and personalities impacting affective experiences following successful deception.
