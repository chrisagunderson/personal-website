## Abstract

For 60 years, the study of human lie detection has painstakingly quantified verbal and nonverbal behaviors that occur during lies, as compared to truths, in search of cues to deception. In parallel, researchers have explicitly asked people, “Is that person lying or telling the truth?” to quantify whether people can accurately determine credibility. The result of these efforts are the dismal conclusions that (a) cues to deception are often subtle and inconsistent, and (b) people are poor lie detectors. Despite this seemingly infertile ground, many productive research lines have emerged in recent years. In this chapter, we describe diverse advances in lie detection research. We consider recent research that aims to understand who lies, why, and when. We examine the resurgent interest in implicit lie detection with research suggesting that implicit judgments about liars and truth-tellers can be more accurate indicators of their credibility than explicit judgments. The extent to which this process involves conscious processes, and the debate about unconscious lie detection, are also discussed. A growing interest in the effect of the observer’s psychological state on lie detection accuracy will also be explored. In addition to these fundamental questions surrounding humans’ natural ability to tell and detect lies, more applied research endeavors have accumulated evidence of empirically-based interviewing techniques, which can increase the transparency of lies. In particular, we will discuss cognitive approaches to interviewing and technological advances in the analysis of behavioral cues to deception. Recent bursts of creativity in the study of lie detection will undoubtedly lead to further basic and applied insights into human deception and provide novel avenues for improving lie detection accuracy.
